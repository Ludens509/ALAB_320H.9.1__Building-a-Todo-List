## Overview

After completing this lab, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Use the useReducer and/or useImmerReducer hook to manage state with reducer functions.
- Use useState in places where reducers are not appropriate or necessary.
- Implement controlled forms and inputs.
- Effectively decide where pieces of state should live.
- Use conditional rendering and conditional styling to provide a positive, interactive user experience.
- Create a complete React application from a set of desired functionality.
